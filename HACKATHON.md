# Hackathon build log

Moonlight is being built for the Meta Global AI Developer Hackathon, Build for Your World track. This log distinguishes implemented behavior from planned work.

## 2026-10-27 — Repository bootstrap

- Added the installable Python 3.11+ package skeleton and pinned runtime/development dependencies.
- Added Windows CI for installation, Ruff, mypy, and pytest, plus local Ruff and Gitleaks commit hooks.
- Added contribution templates, a sample environment file, documentation and results placeholders, and a package import smoke test.
- No collection, AI reasoning, policy execution, file action, or UI behavior is implemented yet.

## Evidence schema

- Added validated process and storage evidence bundles with deterministic citation IDs, duplicate rejection, timezone-aware timestamps, and explicit unavailable/error reasons.
- Exported the JSON Schema and documented the contract in `docs/evidence.md`.
- Collectors, rules, AI calls, policy behavior, and UI remain unimplemented.

## 2026-10-27 — Process metadata collector

- Added read-only psutil collection for executable path, ancestor names/paths, command line, start time, user, connections, and I/O counters.
- Added PID-plus-creation-time identities and guards against PID reuse.
- Added mocked success, denied, exited, timeout, and OS-error coverage with independent unavailable/error evidence for each field.
- If creation time cannot be established, return a structured collection error.
- Rules, AI calls, policy execution, and UI remain unimplemented.

## Planned evaluation

The [PRD](Moonlight%20Product%20Requirements%20Document.md) defines process and storage rule metrics, citation coverage, schema validity, ablations, and robustness scenarios. Results will include the labeled-set size and reproduction method when measurements exist. No performance or safety metric is claimed yet.
